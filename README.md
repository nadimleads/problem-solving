# Problem Solving Repository

This is a structured problem-solving repository where I continuously push my coding and logical problem-solving practice, with a strong focus on understanding how computer actually works at a fundamental level.

# What This Repository Contains

- Topic-wise Data Structures & Algorithms problems

- I use Python to solve problems, BUT written manually (I dont use Python's built-in methods!!)

- Problems originally solved on platforms such as LeetCode and others.

- Mathematical and logical problems solved using Python

- I try to write Memory-efficient and well-structured logic

The goal is not only to solve problems, but to build my strong fundamentals that can be translated across different technologies.

# How I Solve Problems

- Firstly, Understanding the problem statement and constraints clearly.

- then I think how Would I solve this problem IN REAL LIFE, then I think how can I implement this using Coding by breaking the problem into smaller parts.

- Implementing a straightforward and correct solution first

- then gradually I try to improve the solution by focusing on: Time complexity & Memory efficiency.

# Tools & Tech

Language: Python

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Editor: VS Code

# Ongoing & Future Plans

- Continuously add new problems and refine existing solutions

- Improve optimization

- Planning to start solving different mathematical problems with Python coding.
